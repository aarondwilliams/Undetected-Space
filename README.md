# Undetected-Space
Undetected Space Algorithm for Robotics Seminar in C++
Aaron Williams - Spring 2018

Shows examples of datastructures, high-level algorithms, recursion, and a basic graphics interface. Uses QT. The objective was to create a 2-dimensional path planner using purely geometrical means.  Didn't work too well compared to other existing algorithms.
